I've created this GitHub repository which contains all the programs taught in PPS (chapter wise).
This repository will be updated regularly and I'm trying my best to keep it up-to-date.
So if anyone wants to have a look at any program or want to revise, can visit this repository.
Also for mobile users where the GDB compiler isn't optimised can copy and paste the code in any mobile compatible compilers.
I've tried my best to avoid any errors and not to miss any program but still if there are any I'd be grateful if you please let me know.
Thank you .
